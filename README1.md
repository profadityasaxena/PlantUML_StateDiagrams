# ATM Machine UML Modelling

This project focuses on modeling an ATM machine using UML State Diagrams in detail. The primary goal is to represent the valid and invalid transitions between the various components of the ATM system.

## Components of the ATM Machine

Below is the JSON representation of the components of an ATM machine and the valid states for each component:

```json
{
    "ATM": {
        "states": ["Idle", "Processing", "OutOfService"],
        "transitions": {
            "Idle": ["Processing", "OutOfService"],
            "Processing": ["Idle", "OutOfService"],
            "OutOfService": ["Idle"]
        }
    },
    "CardReader": {
        "states": ["Idle", "ReadingCard", "CardEjected"],
        "transitions": {
            "Idle": ["ReadingCard"],
            "ReadingCard": ["CardEjected", "Idle"],
            "CardEjected": ["Idle"]
        }
    },
    "Keypad": {
        "states": ["Idle", "Inputting", "Locked"],
        "transitions": {
            "Idle": ["Inputting"],
            "Inputting": ["Idle", "Locked"],
            "Locked": ["Idle"]
        }
    },
    "Screen": {
        "states": ["Idle", "DisplayingMenu", "DisplayingError"],
        "transitions": {
            "Idle": ["DisplayingMenu", "DisplayingError"],
            "DisplayingMenu": ["Idle", "DisplayingError"],
            "DisplayingError": ["Idle"]
        }
    },
    "CashDispenser": {
        "states": ["Idle", "DispensingCash", "OutOfCash"],
        "transitions": {
            "Idle": ["DispensingCash", "OutOfCash"],
            "DispensingCash": ["Idle"],
            "OutOfCash": ["Idle"]
        }
    },
    "ReceiptPrinter": {
        "states": ["Idle", "PrintingReceipt", "OutOfPaper"],
        "transitions": {
            "Idle": ["PrintingReceipt", "OutOfPaper"],
            "PrintingReceipt": ["Idle"],
            "OutOfPaper": ["Idle"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Objectives

- Model the ATM system using UML State Diagrams.
- Ensure all transitions between states are valid and well-defined.
- Provide a detailed representation of the ATM's behavior under various scenarios.
- Create two models:
  - One showing only valid transitions (highlighted in **green**).
  - One showing invalid transitions (highlighted in **red**).

## How to Use

1. Review the JSON structure to understand the components and their states.
2. Use UML tools to create state diagrams based on the provided data.
3. For the valid transitions model:
   - Highlight valid transitions in **green**.
4. For the invalid transitions model:
   - Highlight invalid transitions in **red**.
5. Validate the transitions to ensure they align with the expected behavior of an ATM machine.

## Tools

- UML Diagramming Tools (e.g., Lucidchart, Visual Paradigm, or PlantUML)
- Text Editor for JSON and Markdown files

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by improving the state definitions, adding more components, or refining the representation of valid and invalid transitions.
