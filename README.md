# 🧠 PlantUML State Diagrams Collection

This repository showcases a collection of state diagrams modeled using **PlantUML**, focusing on real-world systems such as:

- 🚗 Car System
- 🏧 ATM Machine
- 🍽️ Automatic Dishwasher

Each system is broken down into modular components, and their behavior is captured using state transitions.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Car.plantuml` — State diagram for vehicle systems like engine, doors, and fuel.
- `Dishwasher.plantuml.pl` — Component-level model of a dishwashing system.
- `ATMSystemStateDiagram.svg` — Visual output of ATM state modeling.
- `.svg` diagrams — Rendered PlantUML outputs for easy preview.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Visualize dynamic behavior of everyday systems.
- Capture valid and invalid state transitions.
- Build modular PlantUML models for reuse and simulation.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Usage

- Install [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) or use the [PlantUML Live Editor](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).
- Open `.plantuml` files to view or modify system models.
- Use `.svg` files for quick diagram previews.

To render a diagram:

```bash
plantuml Car.plantuml
